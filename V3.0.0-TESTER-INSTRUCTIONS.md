## ðŸŽ° How The Mining Works

### NO PROOF-OF-WORK REQUIRED!

To participate in block rewards:
1. **Link your wallet** to the node via the miner panel
2. **Stay synced** within 2 blocks of the network tip
3. **Maintain 1+ peer connection**

That's it! Block rewards are randomly distributed to eligible nodes every 2 seconds.

### Optional: "Make Fans Go Brr" Mining Button
- This is **satisfaction only** - doesn't affect rewards!
- Rewards come from the mining, not mining
- Feel free to click it for fun ðŸ˜„
