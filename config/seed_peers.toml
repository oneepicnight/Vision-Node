# Seed Peers Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: Seed peers are BOOTSTRAP nodes only, not authorities!
# - Seeds help new nodes discover the network initially
# - Once connected, nodes exchange peer lists and persist discovered peers
# - The network does NOT depend on any specific seed node
# - Consensus rules and chain validation are independent of seeds
# - You can add any working node with --peer flag to bootstrap
#
# Format: array of peer addresses in host:port format (P2P port, not HTTP)

seed_peers = [
    # Example seed peers - replace with actual public node addresses
    # "public-node-1.example.com:7071",
    # "public-node-2.example.com:7071",
    # "192.168.1.100:7071",
    
    # For local development/testing (commented out by default)
    # "localhost:7071",

# Bootstrap URL for dynamic peer discovery
# This endpoint provides:
# - Welcome message displayed on startup
# - Recommended node version info
# - Dynamic list of active seed peers
# Note: Bootstrap is used ONLY for initial peer discovery, not consensus
